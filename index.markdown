## Introduction

**This document is unofficial and not endorsed by the University of Waterloo or any prospective employers.**

None of the included writers are lawyers or tax specialists, nor do any of us purport
to have any real knowledge about the contents of this document.

This is a collection of things we as interns wished we knew when we went away 
on our first co-op terms in the US. We hope it helps you out. Many things contained in this
document were gained through mistakes made, as well as conversations with older students.

If you are a past intern and have thoughts/ideas to add to this document,
[let me know](mailto:stephen.holiday@gmail.com). Even better submit a pull
request. I'll note you if you want to be noted.

<section id="Jobs" />
## Jobs

For many, the JobMine process is familiar so we won't speak about that.
You probably know how to get a job.

Something to note is that many companies in the US (particularly California) are
much more laid back and do not care if you wear a suit or not. Depends on the
company. We suit up for Morgan Stanley but not Facebook.

CECS says not to do US in your first year. Even if you only have 4 months of
school under your belt, there is no actual restriction for going in first year.
Some of us have done it without trouble successfully.

<section id="Jobs-Pay" />
### Pay
Ask about the pay in the interview; there is no reason not to. If they tell you that they offer
'*competitive pay*' ask them exactly what the rate is in an email before you accept their offer.
'*Competitive pay*' can range from $25/hr - $45/hr with or without housing and transportation.

<section id="Jobs-Relocation" />
### Relocation
Ask if they offer any help in terms of relocation compensation - and if so, how much.

Many companies offer a housing stipend (a bit of money, often taxable).
Some will offer to put you up in subsidized or free housing (Amazon, Apple etc).
Note that in some cases, if they offer, you don't HAVE to take it, and that 
stipulations for accepting this alternateive could exist 
(Example: Microsoft gives interns $3300/term vs. you-have-to-pay-for corporate housing)

Ask if they cover transportation costs. If you are going to San Francisco, 
Flights can cost roughly $500-750 round trip after tax. 
New York is a lot cheaper - $180 for a one-way trip during a seat sale with Air Canada. 
As for most flights, book well in advance (the visa office tells you not to 
in an orientation session for first-time USA interns, but some writers can vouch against this. 
Seat sales should trump any "waiting period".)

Some people prefer spending a few days in a hotel at their company's expense
as they wrap-up apartment search (as making housing decisions while still in
Canada can be risky). The general consensus is that you should see the place
before deciding if you will live there - MAKE SURE TO BRING CHEQUE/CASH WITH YOU.

Sometimes stipends are large, sometimes they are not. If you're not sure, assume
that your stipend will be taxed at ~26% in California. We've heard you can get
much of it back if you save your receipts; something to look into.

We recommend working at a place that covers some part of your housing,
unless you have the financial ability to not care.

<section id="Jobs-Perks" />
### Perks
Some companies have cool perks like food, bikes, transit passes, happy hour,
snacks, game rooms, pool tables, ping pong, fooseball, etc.

It's worth checking out. Ask past interns, ask the interviewer, or do your own research!

<section id="Paperwork" />
## Paperwork
<section id="Paperwork-J1Visa" />
### J-1 Visa
Once you have your offer, e-mail your recruiter to get all the details about pay
and start date. It is useful for the visa. Also be sure to ask who is picking 
up the J-1 visa expenses. These are tough to take on alone (~$1000), so 
try to get it covered by your employer if at all possible.

CECS and CDS/AIPT (now Cultural Vistas) will guide you through the process.

<section id="Paperwork-BeforeYouGo" />
### Before You Go
Have a second (or third) copy of all travel documents:

1. DS-2019
2. Passport
3. Training Plan
4. SEVIS fee receipt
5. Resume (for customs, weird eh)
6. Map surrounding hotel/apartment
7. Boarding pass

Don't call it a "job" or say you are "working"! The J-1 visa status is not meant for
"working", but rather for "training" in the United States. Remember, you're just
a poor little intern *training* in the United States!

Some interns prefer keeping all the above as a digital copy in their Dropbox/Google Docs so
they have instant access to them just in case they lose anything.

If you are a US citizen, some of the above do not apply to you.
Make sure you have your U.S. passport, health insurance card, and boarding pass.

<section id="Paperwork-SSN" />
### Getting your SSN
Apply for your SSN as soon as you have been in the U.S. for at least *10 days*. It
takes 10 days for SEVIS to sync up with the SSA's database of people eligible to
apply for a social security number. Yes, you have to wait for them to copy by
hand and deliver the data by pidgeon. If you apply early, they'll lie to you
that it will be okay if you do it, but it will not work and you will just have
to try again later.

Some people have entered the U.S. ahead of time by driving to Buffalo or Detroit.
They enter on their J-1 to to get the SEVIS wait process started as well as get
a cell phone or bank account. Keep in mind that the immigration center in
Buffalo can take an hour and a half.

#### SSN Application
1. Fill in form SS-5 available at the
   [Social Security Administration's website](http://ssa.gov/ssnumber/).
2. Bring forms and documentation to your local SSA office.

OR

1. Show up, fill out the form while waiting. There's a good chance that they'll
   have a pile of those forms for you and you have to wait a long time anyway.

#### SSA Offices

##### Mountain View
Not as long of a wait to get into the office (not as much security screening),
but took longer for the card to arrive.

##### San Jose Downtown
Long wait just to get into the building (outdoor wait due to security
screening), but card arrived in 2 business days (was promised two weeks).

As with everything else, your mileage may vary.

<section id="Living-Housing" />
## Housing
You'll want to start your search early.

Check out the area specific section for more info.
<section id="Living-Roommates" />
### Roommates
It's easier (and cheaper) to find a place for 3 or 4 people than it is to for a
single person for a 4-month lease.

Contact your company and try to get emails of other Waterloo students going down
the same time as you.

Contact them and ask them to meet up somewhere in Waterloo for dinner.
It gives everyone a great opportunity to meet each other, get a feel for who
would be a good roommate for your style.

<section id="Living-Tips" />
### Apartment Hunting Tips
* Paying a deposit is common
* Don't pay a deposit of any kind to *see* an apartment
* Utilities included is less common than Waterloo
* 4-month leases are harder to come by than Waterloo
* Paying the first months rent in full by certified check is common
* Bring enough money for first month's rent and security
* Cashing a Canadian cheque in the U.S. takes a long time (even if it's a U.S.D.
  account)--cash is still the preferred method of choice for payments
* Sometimes you can get your stipend ahead of time if you already have an
  American bank account. Note that if you get your stipend in December for
  a winter work term, you'll have to do taxes during your work term for the
  stipend money.
* Use CECS's hot housing leads (if they apply for your city)
* Ask your company to ask current interns where they are living and what
  recommendations they have
* Check the Area Specific notes for specific recommendations
* There are "hotels" with weekly rates lower than renting an apartment
* Some places are very low tech, so, if looking for a hotel, the best option
  is to just walk around the area and ask every hotel about their long-term rates.

*Vacation Rentals* or *Corporate Housing* work well for our 4-month terms.
Some websites I've used are:

* [Airbnb Sublets](http://www.airbnb.com/sublets) -- monthly vacation rentals
* [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/) -- nightly vacation rentals

  * Good for when you're unable to move in for a couple of days, especially in
    the SF Bay Area. Typically cheaper than a hotel. Use common sense and good
    judgement, always read the reviews.

* [Vacation Rentals by Owner](http://vrbo.com) -- vacation rentals
* [AMSI](http://www.amsires.com/) -- corporate housing
* [Corporate Housing by Owner](http://www.corporatehousingbyowner.com/)

<section id="Living-CellService" />
### Cell Service
Unless you're one of those crazy people who wanders around for wifi (I'm looking
at you Deepinder), you'll want to get cell service.

If you just want a phone that makes phone calls and texts (weirdo) you can get
some cheap pay as you go phone. Stephen has a BOOST prepaid phone which he uses
for when people come to visit him and hasn't had any trouble with it.

<section id="Living-CellService-Smartphones" />
#### Smartphones
Getting data for your smartphone is a lot easier than a BlackBerry.
If you have an unlocked phone, it's really easy. You can get a plan with a sim
card, pop it in, and walk out of the store Facebooking up a storm.

T-Mobile and AT&T both offer options in this arena.

Simple mobile is also very good if you don't care about data speeds. They have
a fixed price, pay up front, no hidden fees. We've never had problems
with the voice or texting service. They have unlimited to 52 countries for $10
extra. (but you don't need it if you just call Canada - read on) They limit
you to about 120kbps (yes, kilobits) with the $40 plan. You can get more with
the $60 plan, but it's not much better in San Francisco because of the
limitations of their network, and they might throttle you anyway. If you choose
these guys, you might have to change your phone's APN settings to get data. Look
at the instructions on their website.

In the past some groups were able to get a reduced rate by getting a family
plan.

##### Straight Talk

[Straight Talk](https://www.straighttalk.com/) is an option if data speeds are
a concern. They have unlimited calling, texting and data for $45 a month without
a contract. There is also a plan for unlimited calling to select international
countries for $60 a month also with unlimited texting and data. Note that the
unlimited isn't 100% unlimited, if you use more than 80-100MB a day you will
likely get kicked off. They operate as a AT&T/T-Mobile reseller so you will get
the benefits of AT&T's network, e.g 4G data without doing business with them.

To get service you must order a micro-SIM or SIM card from their
[store](http://straighttalksim.com/) along with a one month or three month plan.
The card is roughly $15 and it takes 3 days to ship. If your GSM phone can
operate on AT&T, e.g. iPhone and most GSM phones, you should order an *AT&T*
compatible SIM card as they have the best GSM network in the country.

Once you have received everything you can
[activate](https://www.straighttalk.com/Activate) your service online using the
SIM Card and the plan you purchased. If you are porting a number from another
carrier it takes about another day for everything to finish. They have pretty
good customer service so if anything goes wrong you should call them
immediately. Since they are not a big carrier most phones, e.g. iPhone, do not
have the APN settings built in for data. The package you receive contains the
APN settings you need. You will need to figure out how to set the settings for
your phone.

##### Roam Mobility

[Roam Mobility](http://www.roammobility.com/) is another option if L/D is a 
concern and you don't want to use Google Voice or another "alternative". 
As of 2012, this company offers U.S. "roaming" service for $62/mo. It
is "all-inclusive"; you get unlimited talk/text between the U.S. and Canada,
and you get 2GB of data per month on top of that. You also get all of the same
"bonus" features as T-Mobile, Sprint, or AT&T offer: Voicemail & Caller ID.

Michael wishes Roam had service in Canada; he'd replace Bell in a heartbeat.
You order a micro-SIM card from their SIM, which gets delivered to you.
After activating it, you can add one-month plans (or however long you want,
but one-month is the highest "discount rate" they offer).

This company gives you an American number automatically when you register
the SIM card, so you don't need to worry about porting over your old number.
It works in any GSM-unlocked phone - Michael recommends the SGS2 (Samsung
Galaxy S2) as it is the easiest to unlock (via software + Root); iPhones
and other choices of smartphone are not as easily unlock-able, and thus
the user pays more to unlock these "globalized" features of using their 
phone on alternate carriers.

In the end, the onus is on the user to do as much research as possible
before selecting a carrier. Roam is easily the best for those who want
to keep in contact with their American friends, while still being able
to keep in touch with family or friends back home on the same device. 
Offering data as well for $1/GB/mo is a ridiculously nice add-on, as well.

<section id="Living-CellService-BlackBerry" />
#### BlackBerry
There are a few options. Stephen's a BlackBerry user who would die without BBM
and Google Maps. The main problem is that people don't like giving you data
without a 1-2 year commitment. This section is only about getting your
BlackBerry on the network *with BIS*.

He used to use T-Mobile with a weird prepaid plan but they stopped that and make
you put down a deposit. He's told that this may have changed, you may want to
check this one in your state.

His one friend knows a trick with AT&T where you can get them to check your
Canadian credit history. He tried it and spend an hour arguing with the staff
telling them it could be done and gave up. His friend told him it takes about
three hours before they will relent, uggh.

He tried SimpleMobile Winter '12 and had mixed feelings. Their
customer support is pretty terrible, they don't know what BIS is and they think
data is data. But you can get it to work, and the service itself is fine (He
thinks they actually are on T-Mobile).

Note, if you have a Rogers/AT&T phone it will likely only get EDGE not 3G.

Akshay just sticks to using Rogers' BIS One Rate Plan - $35 for 500 MB of BIS
data. Then, he uses a SIP client on it to make calls (Google Voice/Voip.ms).
You don't pay too much to Rogers, and you save on roaming costs as well.
Win/win.

<section id="Living-CellService-LongDistance" />
### Long distance
The reason you don't need to pay extra for long distance to Canada is you can
use Google Voice for this. Normally to use Google Voice to call Canada for free,
you dial a number and then type in the number you want to call and they connect
you. This is not necessary if you have an Android phone. Get the Google Voice
app and it will do this for you transparently, so you can just call Canada for
free and it will use Google Voice. It's really, really nice. Note that you need
to have an internet connection to take advantage of the automated Google Voice
proxying.

<section id="Money" />
## Money

As stated previously, be sure to bring at least $3,000 U.S.D. with you if you
have not signed a lease or have a confirmed place to stay for the duration of 
your internship. While the customs agent nor the visa provider check this, it
is adviseable since you only have a small allotment amount of travel material
that you can take with you on any flight (Porter offers one free bag, but some
go with Air Canada for the more major airports and frequent service).

Expect to spend $200 U.S.D. on arrival for food and other "move-in" material.

<section id="Money-Banks" />
### Banks
You'll want to do this as soon as you can, you can do this without an SSN.
Bring your passport and drivers license as well as your student card. Most banks
will give you a free checking account if you are a student.

Note: Some banks have a savings account.
You may not want one for several reasons:

* There may be a minimum balance after 6 months
* Having interest income in the U.S. can complicate taxes (not an expert)

Choosing a Bank is up to you and your preferences.
Stephen suggests you stick to one of:

* Chase Bank (owned by J.P. Morgan and Chase)
* Bank of America
* Wells Fargo

If you are in NYC Chase is definitely the one to open.
(There are literally as many Chase branches and ATMs as there are Tim Hortons
in Canada.) Several people have been told that Chase is fairly conservative 
when it comes to giving credit cards to "new Americans".
(Banks in Canada like Bank of Montreal offer U.S.D. MasterCards, be sure to
pick one up either on your own or from your parents to ensure you have capital!)

Bank of America is pretty good in the SF/Bay Area.
Chase is OK there too. They also have many branches there - and they are
very nice!

BoA and Chase have ATMs that scan cheques instead of using envelopes.
Others might have this too.

Wells Fargo is known for being super nice.
Wells Fargo has been seen by at least one person as being tougher for a CC.

You will *not* need a SSN to open an account at the three listed banks.
Bring your passport and visa. You don't even need a permanent address.
Some have had luck with using their hotel's or their company's.

Stephen's always kept a U.S. bank account open.
It's super useful to have. If you come back to the U.S. again you're all setup.
If you travel you can get cash easy. If you want to buy stuff online it's great.

Eric says that keeping your bank account open is also great for getting credit
in the future.

Some people want to close their account to avoid bank fees.
Most banks (BoA, Chase, Wells Fargo) offer a _student account_ for 5 years from
when you sign up. Bring your student ID card. They don't require any minimum
activity other than some nominal balance. Some _savings_ accounts have fees.

#### Starting Money
You should bring money down to start with, it will help with deposits and
first/last month rent.

You may also want a simple way to access your funds in Canada without a huge
fee. Note, xe.com will likely get you a better rate. But the following method is
very flexible. This method worked out pretty well for Prashanth: 

1. Open a U.S Bank Account with your Canadian Bank (Prashanth used TD but
   recommend RBC, RBC has a U.S. branch as well though none in California) 
2. Transfer some money to this account to last you for a few weeks in U.S.
3. Get a U.S. Dollar Credit Card from Canada and use this for initial spending.
   If you are not eligible, you can ask your parents to open it for you and a
   get a credit card in your name. You can use this card until you have money
   in your U.S. account.
4. Open a U.S. Bank account at either Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo.

<section id="Money-Credit" />
### Credit Cards
One thing that many try to do right away is get a credit card.

Getting credit in the U.S. can be tricky; especially if you are under 21.

Keep in mind that instead of Interac for debit cards, all American debit cards
(also known as "check cards") are actually VISA/MasterCard cards. You can use
them anywhere you would use a credit card except the money comes out of your
account immediately.

You can get a Secured Credit card where you put some money into a special
account and that amount becomes your credit limit. Something to look into.

Sometimes you can get BoA or TD America to look up your Canadian credit history.
TD Ameritrade and BoA has a Canadian credit check form.
Really tough if you are under 21.

Eric would like to stress the importance of getting a credit card and building
credit history in the States. It's expecially useful if you plan to move to the
U.S. after you graduate.

There are some
[things to consider](http://www.mint.com/blog/how-to/10-credit-score-commandments/)
when dealing with credit cards. Particularly not using all of your available
credit. Many say you should use less than 30% of your credit to maintain a good
score.

Eric says the following about BoA's credit policy:
> BoA credit card policy is to not tell you what the maximum credit limit you
> can get. You have to request a number and then they'll negotiate via phone. My
> suggestion is once you have about a month or two of usage on your credit card,
> you request a large credit increase online (usually double what your limit
> currently is). Then in about 30 minutes you can call 866 506 5068 (direct line
> to a credit department agent) to negotiate an increase. Results vary widely on
> this one.

#### Bank of America - Canadian Credit Check

This worked for an 18 year old guy with two credit cards in good standing back
in Canada. Apply for the card at the branch in person. When asked for your
information, inform them that you would like to request a Canadian credit bureau
check to augment your U.S. credit bureau reports (especially important if it's
your first work term in the States). If the representative is knowledgeable,
they will process the credit card application normally and then will ask you to
call a number (or call for you on your behalf) about 24-48 hours later
(excluding weekends). If not, here's the number you can call: 1-888-503-6092.
They'll ask for your Canadian SIN number and your last address in Canada. YMMV.

One surefire way of getting a credit card fairly soon would be to apply for a
Capital One credit card that's directly targeted for people with no credit
history/newcomers. Beware this card is free for the first year, but costs around
$30 per year after that.

<section id="Money-Convert" />
### Bringing Money Back
There are a lot of ways to bring your hard earned dough back to Canada.

Some really creative ways:

* Bring it in cash across the border (if it's over 10k you need to declare it.
  it's a lot in $20's, Stephen doesn't do this anymore).
* Mailing it by UPS/FedEx insured (got this from a TD Canada banker)
* Buying equity on a cross listed item and selling it on a Canadian exchange
  (best rate I hear, but sounds tricky). This is called
  [Norbet's Gambit](http://www.finiki.org/index.php?title=Norbert%27s_Gambit).

Some more tame ways:

* [xe.com](http://www.xe.com/), this is the preferred method.
  Generally a 1.5% spread which is pretty good.
* Wire transfer
* Cash a check (takes 20-30 days I hear)
* RBC Royal Bank (they have a cross boarder checking account, but the spread is
  usually 2.5%, Stephen doesn't do this any more)
* Using your family member who works at a bank and gets currency exchanged at
  cost (We're told this is the best possible)

If you end up with American funds in Canada, Stephen recommends opening a U.S.
dollar account and convert it over time so you don't get bit by the exchange
rate. You can use xe.com even with a U.S.D. account in Canada.

Stephen also keeps some U.S.D. funds in a U.S.D. TD account in Canada so he can get
small bills and sell U.S.D. to family without a spread.

Stephen sucks at playing the market so he just transfer money over ~$1k at a
time to try and even out my loss/gain. Stephen and Chris love xe.com's bid
system. With xe, you can make a trade right away or set a transaction to occur
once the rate hits some desired value.

Keep in mind that some banks charge different spreads depending on how much you
transfer. $1,100 worked best for Stephen.

Spreads are not always fixed, weekends can cost more so be careful.

Stephen's favourite method is still xe.com.

<section id="Money-Taxes" />
### Taxes
*Disclaimer*: No author of this document knows anything about taxes, accounting,
or even arithmetic. Do not rely on this document. Speak to a professional.

Sadly you will have to pay taxes on your hard-earned income. Chances are you
already paid the American ones in your paycheque. Depending on your State and
situation you will end up receiving much (50% is not unreasonable) of that back.
You may owe money in Canada. You definitely have to fill out both Canadian
Federal and Provincial forms as well as U.S. Federal and State.

It's not to hard to fill them out yourself but it's fairly annoying.
Make sure you file with your Canadian address as your home address.
If you file with a Canadian address you get an automatic extension (not sure how
long, believe it's 1 month).

Some people have had luck with this
[free government program][IRS-FreeTaxReturn].

CECS has [some information][CECA-USIncomeTax] on taxes.
Stephen used "Peter Cuttini" (contact info on Waterloo site) for his 2011 taxes.
He's heard good things about him for co-op students (cost: around $300).
Stephen was not very impressed with the work and will be likely doing them
himself for 2012. He did them in 2011 and found them not much harder than
discussing with your accountant.

H&R Block will also do it for around $300.

There are short versions of U.S. forms for non-residents (you may not apply) which
Stephen used last tax year.

The main question Stephen had was whether he had to pay taxes twice in both
Canada and the U.S.. In his situation, Canada knew how much he was taxed in the U.S.
and applied some formula to not tax him twice (covered in U.S. visa orientation).

The IRS has a [good section][IRS-AlienExemptions] on how many exceptions you can
claim.

<section id="Misc" />
## Miscellaneous
* Amazon gives free shipping for 1 month through Prime. Get one intern to signup
  at a time so you can have free shipping all work term
* Woot.com is awesome
* Waterloo holds [alumni events](http://alumni.uwaterloo.ca/alumni/events/usa/)
  which are often open to students.
* CECS runs a photo contest every term, one for US co-ops and one for
  international co-ops.
  * They encourage you to take pictures with other Waterloo co-ops and of the
    places you visit.
  * They do have the right to use it for promotional purposes.
  * You get a certificate for participation as well as money for the top 3
    winners. It's a good way to share your experiences and you might be up for
    some money for grabs.

<section id="Area" />
## Area Specific Notes
I've been to three main areas and will focus on info for those.
If you are an intern and have more info let me know (areas edited appropriately).

<section id="Area-California" />
### California (General)
* In-N-Out burger is a must try. Checkout the Animal Style burger on their 
  [secret menu](http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp).
* Many people like [Chipotle](http://www.chipotle.com/)
* Eric found [USAA](www.usaa.com) very useful for car rentals.

  * The website will make it seem like its for active-duty military or veterans,
    but everyone with an SSN is eligible for the shopping discounts.
    Not eligible for the insurance, however.
  * Car rental benefits are
    [here](https://www.usaa.com/inet/pages/rental_cars_main_public?wa_ref=pub_global_products_travel_rentalcars)
  * The main thing is that the underage fee is waived for all car companies
    (which saves a heck of a lot of money) and there's a discount (usually 10%)
    woven into there as well. You can also get these without going through USAA
    but USAA has the benefit of combining the two into one discount code. Hertz
    in particular allows for two discount codes, so you can often layer the 
    discounts on and save a lot.
  * Being part of USAA also means you get free club gold membership into Hertz,
    which lets you build points for stuff like free day rentals, weekend
    rentals, etc.
  * Being with USAA is also helps if you are under 20 and want to rent a car.
* Tips when actually renting:

  * Insurance is usually peddled with the car rental at the counter
    (eg. liability, loss damage insurance, colllision). If you have car
    insurance in Canada either on your own or with your parents, they may cover
    this already (be sure to have a copy of it on you when you drive).
  * Go for the smallest car (sub-compact rental). You may want a larger vehicle
    at the start, but you can often ask for a free upgrade at the counter and
    they'll give you one. You can get a Civic, Corolla, Jetta or sometimes even
    a VW Passat/other full size sedan just by asking.
  * Some rental companies will often pick you up from where you are
    living/working and drive you to their rental location.
  * For Hertz, try and layer the discounts (CDP and PC codes). You can get cheap
    rates like 50 dollars (tax included) for a 3 day weekend car rental. It
    makes for some awesome road trips
  * Avoid renting cars from airports unless necessary - they tack on a bunch of
    dumb charges that you can't waive (eg. airport concession fee, terminal
    fees, etc.). They also don't give free upgrades unless forced to via
    discount codes.

<section id="Area-SF" />
### San Francisco
* Since SF is a city, prices are pretty high.
* It's very tough to find housing in the city, especially for cheap.
* Stuff is slanted. They're not exaggerating in movies and pictures, the hills
  are *steep*. You know that scene in The Princess Diaries where she's pushing
  her scooter up the hill? We know you watched it - that's not a cheap scooter,
  those hills are vicious.
* Get a SafeWay Card, it's free and literally saved me over $100. Also, tell them
  you'll fill it out later and you're in a hurry. That way you get the discounts,
  but they don't have your personal information.
* There are some beautiful parts (check out the Presidio near the Golden Gate
  Bridge), some crazy parts (Haight-Ashbury has things you never imagined
  existed. Everyone is high.), and some very sketchy parts (Stay out of the
  Tenderloin, especially at night. We repeat,
  *stay out of the Tenderloin at night*.) Familiarize yourself with the
  neighbourhoods and use common sense.
* Fun fact - it has [the lowest proportion of children](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/09/families-flee-san-francisco_n_1335639.html)
  of any major city in the US!

#### Transportation
* MUNI is the basic transit service, there are buses, streetcars, cable cars
  (streetcars that go up steep hills, $6/ride and in tourist areas) and subways
  as well.
* BART is a high-speed subway-ish system that goes around the more city-like
  parts of the Bay Area and hits more major destinations. BART from the airport
  to SF is super clean and ~$8.
* An Airport shuttle is a good alternative to Taxi and BART, especially if you
  have a lot of luggage. For only $16 they will drop you off in front of almost
  any hotel. I used GO Lorrie's Airport Shuttle to get to Park Hotel.
* Caltrain is a light-rail system that goes through all of Silicon Valley for 
  under $10. If you've heard of the GO train in the GTA, it's similar. They do 
  often check tickets though!
* Clipper Card is a free card you can get and load with money which can be used
  on all of these transit systems seamlessly. Get one.
* For larger road trips, rent a [zipcar](http://www.zipcar.com/) (car sharing
  service). 5 people in a car only end up paying $15 each, don't need to pay for
  gas.
* [Ubers](http://uber.com): popular and stylish alternative to taxis.
  You get a private driver and payment is hassle free--they'll automatically
  charge the credit card you have on file (including tip).
  You can request an Uber via SMS, or from their iPhone or Android app. The
  seats are extremely comfortable.

#### Housing
* [Paramount/SFO Housing](http://www.sfohousing.com/) has decent pricing (Park
  or Herbert). The internet is slow. They are older buildings, and note that
  there are no kitchen facilities to use in Herbert.

  * 2010F - Stephen has stayed at the Park. Liked it, would recommend

* [Pacific Tradewinds](http://www.san-francisco-hostel.com/) is highly
  recommended by one intern who is adventurous and enjoyed living in hostel-like
  acommodations.

  * 2012W - Recommended by an intern. It's feels very home-y
    and undoubtedly a great place to meet technical folks and entrepreneurs.

* If you would rather live in a more student-populated area, Berkeley is an
  option. The commute to the downtown area is 15-20 min, but is worth it if you
  want to meet people your age.

### Food
* If you are looking for cheap, delicious meals, head over to Chinatown.
Big boxes of dim sum for ~$4, bubble tea is only ~$2 (they call it boba)

<section id="Area-BayArea" />
### Bay Area
* Still expensive
* Get a SafeWay Card, it's free and literally saved me over $100
* Learn to love the Caltrain
* Caltrain isn't like the GO, they check your tickets all the time
* Go to Gilroy Premium Outlet Mall in Gilroy, it's amazing and has great deals
* Pizza Hut is not as fancy in the US. It will blow your coworkers' minds if you
  tell them that Pizza Hut is a sit down restaurant with waiters
* Gilroy Premium Outlets is pretty awesome and worth a trip after your first
  paycheque

#### Activites


* [Helicopter Flying](http://verticalcfi.com/) Yes you get to control the
  helicopter. No license or classes required. Ask for the introductory flight
  lesson.
* [Aerobatic Flying](http://www.aerodynamicaviation.com/store_gift_certificates.php)
  Yes you get to fly the plane and make it do loops and stuff. No license or
  classes required. Look for the gift certificate for aerobatic flying.
* [Skydiving](http://www.santacruz-skydiving.com/) - Eric says it's much better
  than the one near Toronto (he's done both). This one you fall for a full
  minute and you land on the beach. Try and time for an hour or so before
  sunset. He says it's awesome skydiving onto a beach while the sun sets.
* [Paintballing](http://santaclarapaintball.com/) - They usually have good
  groupon deals.
* [Skeet shooting](http://www.coyoteclays.com/) - no license or classes required.
* [Computer History Museum](http://www.yelp.com/biz/computer-history-museum-mountain-view)
  You can easily spend a whole day here.
* [Planet Granite](http://planetgranite.com/locations/sunnyvale/sv_faq.php) for
  those who want to indoor rock climb
* Stanford football game - Eric says they're just like the movies!

#### Trips

* Yosemite National Park
  * Upper Yosemite falls is a long hike (4 hours) but its well worth the views.
    Fairly popular route. Bring water and good shoes and be prepared to be tired.
  * If you're willing to spend two days hiking, you can hike the famous half
    dome.
* Las Vegas
  * Cirque de Soleil shows are a must.
  * Grand Canyon if you have a day or two. Drive out is about 4 hours each way
    however so be warned.
  * Hoover Dam has a nice indoor tour where you get to see the generators and
    water tunnels. Also a beautiful sight.
  * Casinos and restaurants of course on the strip.

* Hawaii (you will need at least four days to a week)
  * One thing about Hawaii is you need to pick which island(s) you want to see.
    They each specialize in different things.
  * in Oahu:
    * [Surfing](http://www.yelp.com/biz/waikiki-surf-lessons-honolulu)
    * [Jet skiing](http://www.yelp.com/biz/aloha-jet-ski-rentals-honolulu#query:jet%20ski)!
      You can drive up to 70-75km/h on these jet skis, and its right next to the
      military airbase -so you can often see and hear F22 raptors flying over
      your head. Makes for a pretty awesome experience
    * [Beautiful view of Honolulu and the surrounding ocean](http://www.yelp.com/biz/diamond-head-state-monument-honolulu):
      about a 20-30 minute hike up.
  * on Big island:
    * [Playing with molten lava](http://www.kalapanaculturaltours.com/)! The 
      national park on the island is alright, but this tour company actual takes
      you out to the lava fields and lets you get up close to molten lava. You
      can even poke it with a stick if you want. One of the highlights of Eric's
      Hawaii trip.
    * [Driving an ATV in the Hawaiian forest](http://www.yelp.com/biz/atv-outfitters-hawaii-halaula-2)
      - A pretty fun ATV driving adventure, and you get to see a couple of awesome waterfalls as well

#### Cupertino

Checkout the Valley Fair Mall and Santana Row. Valley Fair Mall is a typical
mall with everything that you expect in a Canadian Mall. Da' Anza and Stevens
Creek has plenty of eatery's around. If you haven't tried California Pizza 
Kitchen, you have to go immediately. If you want to go clubbing you have to hit
up SF or Mountain View.

##### Malls/Shopping

* [Valley Fair Mall](http://www.valleyfairmall.net)
* [Santana Row](http://www.santanarow.com)

##### Beaches
* [Santa Cruz Boardwalk](http://www.beachboardwalk.com)

#### Housing
* Foster City - [Sand Cove Apartments](http://www.woodmontrentals.com/sand-cove-apartments)
  is a good apartment complex
  and they are very helpful with setting up housing for people out of the
  country. They do flexible leasing and month to month rentals.
  In the past, QuinStreet co-ops have lived at the other properties owned by the
  parent company (Woodmont, who seem to own a lot of land around here).

  * 2010W - Stephen - Liked it, very close to the old QuinStreet buildings.
    2 Bedroom 2 Bath $1909/mo.

* Mountain View - [Central Park at Whisman Station](http://www.centralpark-apts.com/)
  is a good apartment complex and they are very helpful with setting up housing
  for people out of the country. 20 minute walk from Caltrain. Not that convent
  for transit. Safeway is about 2 miles away.

  * 2012W - Stephen - We pay $2700/mo unfurnished plus utilities for 3 bedrooms.
    Clean and very nice. Less than 20 minute bike ride to Google.

<section id="Area-BayArea" />
### San Diego

#### Food
* Stephen waited in the rain for 2 hours to eat at
  [Phil's BBQ](http://www.philsbbq.net/). The ribs are amazing.


<section id="Area-NYC" />
### New York City
* Really expensive (not as much as California / Washington, but still) in general.

* Paying first and last months rent plus one month of security is super common.
* Brokers fees are usually 1 month rent, often more than you'd like.
  * Brokers fees are super negotiable - if you know how to play the game.
  
* More scammers here than any other place encountered, always see the place before you pay.
* Housing moves fast. We got an appointment to see a place, got on the subway
  right away and once we got out the place was already taken
  * Moral: Bring checks with you, that's how you secure a place

* Don't live above 100th Street unless you aren't afraid of anything
* Manhattan Costs Money - but the neighbourhood / conditions may be worth it.
* Wall Street area is surprisingly dead in the evening.

* Brooklyn is much cheaper, consider it (also scarier at night)
* Middle of Brooklyn can be a little sketchier, but Bay Ridge is super beautiful

* Get an MTA MetroCard pass when you arrive, $104/30-day for unlimited travel is a great deal.
  * Best part of this is that it pays for itself after 40 rides.
  
* Trader Joe's is cheap
* Chase Bank is literally everywhere (also in Duane Reade)
* Get a Duane Reade Card

* Watch your stuff on the subway, wallet in front, don't stare at people, etc.
* Flying into LGA is cheaper, NJ transit is good, hard with two suitcases
  * If needed, take a taxi from LGA - but be prepared to pay ~$50 
    (which is average in rush hour).

* There is literally a church after every block - these are more popular
  to visit than Tim Horton's is in Canada (scary, huh?).

#### Housing
* Brooklyn (Bay Ridge) - 328 91st Street, Brooklyn (close to the subway).
  The landlord is Annette Sobczynski (718-974-0368, annetteeve@hotmail.com).
  Multiple furnished apartments.

  * 2011S - Stephen - It was fully furnished for $1900/month, 2 bedrooms,
    large kitchen and a pullout bed in the living room. Stayed for 1 month while
    looking for apartments in Manhattan.

* Residence Hall @ Brooklyn College - 1 Kenilworth Place. Cost was steep, but
  close to subway and other cool places like Target. Literally centre of the
  Brooklyn area. ($5500/4mo/1person) -- Contrary to popular belief, this 
  residence accepts students from ALL universities, not just Brooklyn College.
  
  * Michael Shao currently lives here. He'll update with more once the term
    continues onwards (he's been there about a day).
  
* Manhattan - EHS might not be the best option - people consider it, 
  but remember that the minimum is $7500/term (which is for a triple room, plus
  you don't get to define the term). 
  
* U.S. schools operate on an entirely different (and unforgiving) schedule than
  those in Canada (and especially Waterloo). This place (as well as 
  University Place NY - but that place is just a dump in general) is probably
  not worth your time or your money, as it's as expensive as a Waterloo on-campus
  residence plus a full meal plan, except you don't even get fed here.

#### Food
* There are so many places to eat in NYC, be sure to try new stuff!

* Halcart at 53rd and 6th is to die for.
  Make sure you go to the [right one](http://www.yelp.com/biz/53rd-and-6th-halal-cart-new-york).
  Get the hot sauce. There will be a line, it's worth it.
  
* Pizza - In NY it's a different kind of food. It's also highly contentious
  which place is best.

  * [Grimaldi's](http://www.grimaldis.com/) is usually number 1 or 2 on most
    lists. It will be packed. Go on a weeknight. You will stand outside for
    20-45 minutes or more. On Saturday expect over an hour. You can do take out
    which will be a bit faster. Eat it under the Brooklyn bridge!

  * [Lombardi's](http://www.firstpizza.com/) is really good and in Manhattan.
    The wait is more reasonable.

* [Fat Cat](http://www.fatcatmusic.org/) is a nice bar and has lots of pool
  tables, ping-pong tables and even scrabble. Prices are decent. Also allows
  people under 21 in before a certain time.
  
* [Dallas BBQ](http://www.dallasbbq.com/) is really good and has awesome prices.

* [Carmines](http://carminesnyc.com/) is family style (gigantic plates) Italian
  food and really tasty. Pretty busy.

#### Activities
* [Kayak on the river](http://www.downtownboathouse.org/) for free!
* The [American Museum of Natural History](http://www.amnh.org/) is large and
  fun!
* Go to a comedy club (no suggestions on where yet, though).

<section id="Area-Coopersburg-PA" />
### Coopersburg, PA
* Driving/Bus is probably the easiest and cheapest way to get into PA from ON.
* Bank of America is near Lutron campus and are experienced with dealing with
  international co-ops
* Quiet town
* Minimum necessities close by (food, convenience, pharmacy, bank).
  Government related tasks (e.g. SSN application) have to be done in Allentown
  (20 min drive north).
* Not much to do within walking distance. The area becomes more interesting with
  a car.
* "Nearby" towns/cities include: Philly, NYC
* Plaza near BOA has decent food (Mex, Chinese, Italian, diner) and two large
  grocery stores (it's worth getting the "bonus cards")
* [Musikfest](http://www.fest.org/), a popular free music festival during summer
* Climate is similar to ON but slightly warmer on average
