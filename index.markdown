## Introduction

**This document is unofficial and not endorsed by my school or employers.**

I'm not a lawyer, a tax specialist nor do a purport to have any real knowledge.

This is a collection of things I wished I knew when I went away on my first 
co-op term to the US. I hope it helps you out. Many things contained in this 
document were gained through mistakes and conversations with older students.

This document is a work in progress. While I may say I, that's actually one of 
us (contributors). So you should become one of us so you could be I. Do us got 
it?

If you are a past intern and have thoughts/ideas to add to this document, 
[let me know](mailto:stephen.holiday@gmail.com). Even better submit a pull 
request. I'll note you if you want to be noted.

<section id="Jobs" />
## Jobs

For many, the JobMine process is familiar so I won't speak about that.
You probably know how to get a job.

Something to note is that many companies in the US (particularly California) are 
much more laid back and don't care if you wear a suit or not. Depends on the company. I suit up for Morgan Stanley but not Facebook.

If you read earlier, I got my first co-op in the US. Which is something CECS 
says not to do in your first year. Even if you only have 4 months of school 
under your belt, there is no actual restriction for going in first year.

<section id="Jobs-Pay" />
### Pay
Ask the pay in the interview. There is no reason not too. If they give you some
'*competitive pay*' ask them in an email before you accept their offer.
'*Competitive pay*' can range from $25/hr - $45/hr with or without housing and
plane tickets.

<section id="Jobs-Relocation" />
### Relocation
Ask if they offer any help in terms of relocation.

Many companies offer a housing stipend (a bit of money, often taxable).
Some will put you up in subsidized or free housing (Amazon, Apple etc).

Ask if they cover flight. If you are going to San Francisco, $500-750 round trip 
after tax as a guide. New York is a lot cheaper.

Asking your company to put you in a hotel for a few days has always worked out 
well for me. Instead of making housing decisions while still in Canada (which 
could be pretty risky), I prefer spending a few days in a hotel at my company's 
expense as I wrap-up apartment search.

Sometimes stipends are large, sometimes they are not. If you're not sure, assume 
that your stipend will be taxed at ~26% in California. I've heard you can get 
much of it back if you save your receipts, something to look into.

I'd recommend against working at a place that does not cover some part of your 
housing. If you have the financial ability to not care, then lucky you :-P.

<section id="Jobs-Perks" />
### Perks
Some companies have cool perks like food, bikes, transit passes, happy hour, 
snacks, game rooms, pool tables, ping pong, fooseball, etc.

It's worth checking out.

## Paperwork
<section id="Paperwork-J1Visa" />
### J-1 Visa
Once you have your offer, email your recruiter to get all the details about pay 
and start date. Its useful for the visa.

CECS and CDS/AIPT (now Cultural Vistas) will guide you through the process.
If you have questions ask the awesome Cathy Stein (<cestein@uwaterloo.ca>). 
She's amazing.

<section id="Paperwork-BeforeYouGo" />
### Before You Go
Have a second (or third) copy of all travel documents:

1. DS-2019
2. Passport
3. Training Plan
4. SEVIS fee receipt
5. Resume (for customs, weird eh)
6. Map surrounding hotel/apartment
7. Boarding pass

Don't call it a job or say you are working! The J1 visa status is not meant for 
"working", but rather for "training" in the United States. Remember, you're just 
a poor little intern *training* in the United States!

I prefer keeping all the above as a digital copy in my Dropbox/Google Docs so
I have instant access to them just in case I lose anything.

<section id="Paperwork-SSN" />
### Getting your SSN
Apply for your SSN as soon as you have been in the US for at least *10 days*. It 
takes 10 days for SEVIS to sync up with the SSA's database of people eligible to apply for a social security number.
Yes, you have to wait for them to copy by hand and deliver the data by pidgeon. If you apply early, they'll lie to you
that it will be okay if you do it, but it will not work and you will just have to try again later.

#### SSN Application
1. Fill in form SS-5 available at the [Social Security Administration's website](http://ssa.gov/ssnumber/).
2. Bring forms and documentation to your local SSA office.

OR

1. Show up, fill out the form while waiting. There's a good chance that they'll have a pile of those forms for
you and you have to wait a long time anyway.

#### SSA Offices

##### Mountain View
Not as long of a wait to get into the office (not as much security screening), 
but took longer for the card to arrive.

##### San Jose Downtown
Long wait just to get into the building (outdoor wait due to security 
screening), but card arrived in 2 business days (was promised two weeks).

As with everything else, your mileage may vary.

<section id="Living-Housing" />
## Housing
You'll want to start your search early.

Check out the area specific section for more info.
<section id="Living-Roommates" />
### Roommates
It's easier (and cheaper) to find a place for 3 or 4 people than it is to for a 
single person for a 4-month lease.

Contact your company and try to get emails of other Waterloo students going down 
the same time as you.

Contact them and ask them to meet up somewhere in Waterloo for dinner.
It gives everyone a great opportunity to meet each other, get a feel for who 
would be a good roommate.

I like to find outgoing people who like to travel on weekends, it's a personal 
choice.

<section id="Living-Tips" />
### Apartment Hunting Tips
* Paying a deposit is common.
* Don't pay a deposit of any kind to *see* an apartment.
* Utilities included is less common than Waterloo.
* 4-month leases are harder to come by than Waterloo
* Paying the first months rent in full by certified check is not uncommon
* Bring enough money for first months rent and security
* Cashing a Canadian cheque in the US takes a long time (even if it's a USD 
  account), cash is recommended.
* Sometimes you can get your stipend ahead of time if you already have an 
  American bank account. Note that if you get your stipend in December for
  a winter work term, you'll have to do taxes during your work term for the
  stipend money.
* Use CECS's hot housing leads
* Ask your company to ask current interns where they are living and any 
  recommendations they have
* Check the Area Specific notes for specific recommendations
* There are "hotels" with weekly rates lower than renting an apartment
* Some places are very low tech, so, if looking for a hotel, you are best
  off walking around the area and asking every hotel about their rates.

Craigslist is an option. Before you do so, we would suggest checking "Vacation 
Rental" or "Corporate Housing" websites because they usually work better with 
our 4-month work terms. Some websites I've used are:

AirBnB is also a viable option, especially in the SF Bay Area. If you are stuck
in situations where you are unable to move in for a couple of days, finding
a place on AirBnB will get you a better value for less cost than a hotel. Just
remember to use common sense and good judgement. Always read the reviews.

If you are the adventurous type and enjoy living in hostel-like acommodations, 
I highly recommend Pacific Tradewinds in San Francisco. It's feels very home-y
and undoubtedly a great place to meet technical folks and entrepreneurs.

<section id="Living-CellService" />
### Cell Service
Unless you're one of those crazy people who wanders around for wifi (I'm looking 
at you Deepinder), you'll want to get cell service.

If you just want a phone that makes phone calls and texts (weirdo) you can get 
some cheap pay as you go phone. I have a BOOST prepaid phone which I use for 
when people come to visit me and haven't had any trouble with it.

<section id="Living-CellService-Smartphones" />
#### Smartphones
Getting data for your smartphone is a lot easier than a BlackBerry.
If you have an unlocked phone, it's really easy. You can get a plan with a sim 
card, pop it in, and walk out of the store Facebooking up a storm.

I think T-Mobile and AT&T both offer options in this arena.

Simple mobile is also very good if you don't care about data speeds. They have
a fixed price, pay up front, no hidden fees. I've never had problems
with the voice or texting service. They have unlimited to 52 countries for $10 extra.
(but you don't need it if you just call Canada - read on) They limit
you to about 120kbps (yes, kilobits) with the $40 plan. You can get more with
the $60 plan, but it's not much better in San Francisco because of the limitations
of their network, and they might throttle you anyway. If you choose these guys,
you might have to change your phone's APN settings to get data. Look at the
instructions on their website.

In the past some groups were able to get a reduced rate by getting a family 
plan.

<section id="Living-CellService-BlackBerry" />
#### BlackBerry
There are a few options. I'm a BlackBerry user who would die without BBM and 
Google Maps. The main problem is that people don't like giving you data without 
a 1-2 year commitment. This section is only about getting your BlackBerry on the 
network *with BIS*.

I used to use T-Mobile with a weird prepaid plan but they stopped that and make 
you put down a deposit. I'm told that this may have changed, you may want to 
check this one in your state.

My one friend knows a trick with AT&T where you can get them to check your 
Canadian credit history. I tried it and spend an hour arguing with the staff 
telling them it could be done and gave up. My friend told me it takes about 
three hours before they will relent, uggh.

I tried SimpleMobile this term (Winter '12) and have mixed feelings. Their 
customer support is pretty terrible, they don't know what BIS is and they think 
data is data. But you can get it to work, and the service itself is fine (I 
think they actually are on T-Mobile).

Note, if you have a Rogers/AT&T phone it will likely only get EDGE not 3G.

Akshay just sticks to using Rogers' BIS One Rate Plan - $35 for 500 MB of BIS 
data. Then, he uses a SIP client on it to make calls (Google Voice/Voip.ms).
You don't pay too much to Rogers, and you save on roaming costs as well. 
Win/win.

<section id="Living-CellService-LongDistance" />
### Long distance
The reason you don't need to pay extra for long distance to Canada is you can use
Google Voice for this. Normally to use Google Voice to call Canada for free, you dial a number
and then type in the number you want to call and they connect you. This is not necessary
if you have an Android phone. Get the Google Voice app and it will do this for you transparently, so
you can just call Canada for free and it will use Google Voice. It's really, really nice.
Note that you need to have an internet connection to take advantage of the automated Google
Voice proxying.

<section id="Money" />
## Money
<section id="Money-Banks" />
### Banks
You'll want to do this as soon as you can, you can do this without an SSN.
Bring your passport and drivers license as well as your student card. Most banks 
will give you a free checking account if you are a student.

Note: Some banks have a savings account.
You may not want one for several reasons:

* There may be a minimum balance after 6 months
* Having interest income in the US can complicate taxes (not an expert)

Choosing a Bank is up to you and your preferences.
I'd stick to one of:

* Chase
* Bank of America
* Wells Fargo

If you are in NY Chase is the one to open.
There are so many Chase branches and ATMs.

Bank of America is pretty good in the SF/Bay Area.
Chase is OK there too. They also have many branches there - and they are
very nice!

BoA and Chase have ATMs that scan cheques instead of using envelopes.
Others might have this too.

Wells Fargo is known for being super nice.

You will not need a SSN to open an account at the four listed banks.
Bring your passport and visa. You don't even need a permanent address.
Some have had luck with using their hotel's or their company's.

I've always kept a US bank account open.
It's super useful to have. If you come back to the US again you're all setup.
If you travel you can get cash easy. If you want to buy stuff online it's great.

Some people want to close their account to avoid bank fees.
Most banks (BoA, Chase, Wells Fargo) offer a _student account_ for 5 years from 
when you sign up. Bring your student ID card. They don't require any minimum 
activity other than some nominal balance.

<section id="Money-Credit" />
### Credit Cards
One thing that I and many others try to do right away is get a credit card.

Getting credit in the US is very hard. Especially if you are under 21.

Keep in mind that instead of Interac for debit cards, all American debit cards 
(also known as "check cards") are actually VISA/MasterCard cards. You can use 
them anywhere you would use a credit card except the money comes out of your 
account immediately.

You can get a Secured Credit card where you put some money into a special 
account and that amount becomes your credit limit. Something to look into.

Sometimes you can get BoA or TD America to look up your Canadian credit history.
TD Ameritrade and BoA has a Canadian credit check form.
Really tough if you are under 21.

#### Bank of America - Canadian Credit Check

This worked for an 18 year old guy with two credit cards in good standing back 
in Canada. Apply for the card at the branch in person. When asked for your 
information, inform them that you would like to request a Canadian credit bureau 
check to augment your US credit bureau reports (especially important if it's 
your first work term in the States). If the representative is knowledgeable, 
they will process the credit card application normally and then will ask you to 
call a number (or call for you on your behalf) about 24-48 hours later 
(excluding weekends). If not, here's the number you can call: 1 888 503 6092. 
They'll ask for your Canadian SIN number and your last address in Canada. YMMV.

One surefire way of getting a credit card fairly soon would be to apply for a 
Capital One credit card that's directly targeted for people with no credit 
history/newcomers. Beware this card is free for the first year, but costs around 
$30 per year after that.

<section id="Money-Convert" />
### Bringing Money Back
There are a lot of ways to bring your hard earned dough back to Canada.

Some really creative ways:

* Bring it in cash across the border (10k limit, it's a lot in $20's, I don't do  
  this anymore).
* Mailing it by UPS/FedEx insured (got this from a TD Canada banker)
* Buying equity on a cross listed item and selling it on a Canadian exchange 
  (best rate I hear, but sounds tricky)

Some more tame ways:

* xe.com, this is my preferred method. 1.5% spread which is pretty good.
* Wire transfer
* Cash a check (takes 20-30 days I hear)
* RBC Royal Bank (they have a cross boarder checking account, but the spread is 
  2.5%, I don't do this any more)
* Using your family member who works at a bank and gets currency exchanged at 
  cost (I'm told this is the best possible)

If you end up with American funds in Canada, I recommend opening a US dollar 
account and convert it over time so you don't get bit by the exchange rate.

I suck at playing the market so I just transfer money over ~$1k at a time to try 
and even out my loss/gain.

Keep in mind that some banks charge different spreads depending on how much you 
transfer. $1,100 worked best for me.

<section id="Money-Taxes" />
### Taxes
*Disclaimer*: No author of this document knows anything about taxes, accounting 
or even arithmetic. Do not rely on this document. Speak to a professional.

CECS has [some information](http://www.ceca.uwaterloo.ca/students/international/US_Income_Tax.php) on taxes.
Stephen plans on being lazy and using "Peter Cuttini" (contact info on Waterloo 
site) this term.
He's heard good things about him for co-op students. (Around $300).

H&R Block will also do it for around $300.

Some people have had luck with this [free government program](http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=107626,00.html).

Sadly you will have to pay taxes on your hard-earned income. Chances are you 
already paid the American ones in your paycheque. Depending on your State and 
situation you will end up receiving much (50% is not unreasonable) of that back. 
You may owe money in Canada. You definitely have to fill out both Canadian 
Federal and Provincial forms as well as US Federal and State.

There are short versions of US forms for non-residents (you may not apply) which 
Stephen used last tax year.

The main question Stephen had was whether I had to pay taxes twice in both 
Canada and the US. In his situation, Canada knew how much he was taxed in the US 
and applied some formula to not tax him twice.

The IRS has a [good section](http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=129233,00.html)
on how many exceptions you can claim.

<section id="MISC" />
## MISC
* Amazon has no tax in California
* Amazon gives free shipping for 1 month through Prime, get one intern to signup 
  at a time you can have free shipping all work term
* Woot.com is awesome
* Waterloo holds [alumni events](http://alumni.uwaterloo.ca/alumni/events/usa/) 
  which are often open to students.

---

<section id="Area" />
## Area Specific Notes
I've been to three main areas and will focus on info for those.
If you are an intern and have more info let me know.

<section id="Area-California" />
### California (General)
* In-n-out burger is must try. Checkout the Animal Style burger on their [secret menu](http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp).
* Many people like [Chipotle](http://www.chipotle.com/)

<section id="Area-SF" />
### San Francisco
* Since SF is a city, prices are pretty high.
* It's very tough to find housing in the city, especially for cheap.
* Stuff is slanted. They're not exaggerating in movies and pictures, the hills 
  are *steep*. You know that scene in The Princess Diaries where she's pushing 
  her scooter up the hill? We know you watched it - that's not a cheap scooter, 
  those hills are vicious.
* Get a SafeWay Card, it's free and literally saved me over $100. Also, tell them
  you'll fill it out later and you're in a hurry. That way you get the discounts,
  but they don't have your personal information.
* There are some beautiful parts (check out the Presidio near the Golden Gate 
  Bridge), some crazy parts (Haight-Ashbury has things you never imagined 
  existed. Everyone is high.), and some very sketchy parts (Stay out of the 
  Tenderloin, especially at night. I repeat,
  *stay out of the Tenderloin at night*.) Familiarize yourself with the 
  neighbourhoods and use common sense.
* Fun fact - it has [the lowest proportion of children of any major city in the US](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/09/families-flee-san-francisco_n_1335639.html)!
  If you hate the smelly little buggers, you're in good company.

#### Transportation
* MUNI is the basic transit service, there are buses, streetcars, cable cars 
  (streetcars that go up steep hills, $6/ride and in tourist areas) and subways 
  as well.
* BART is a high-speed subway-ish system that goes around the more city-like 
  parts of the Bay Area and hits more major destinations. BART from the airport 
  to SF is super clean and ~$8.
* Caltrain is a light-rail system that goes through all of Silicon Valley for 
  under $10. If you've heard of the GO train in the GTA, it's similar. They do 
  often check tickets though!
* Clipper Card is a free card you can get and load with money which can be used 
  on all of these transit systems seamlessly. Get one.

#### Housing
* [Paramount/SFO Housing](http://www.sfohousing.com/) is pretty decent (Park or 
  Herbert). The internet is slow. They are older buildings.
  
  * 2010F - Stephen has stayed at the Park. Liked it, would recommend

### Food
* Hipsters just drink tea.
  
<section id="Area-BayArea" />
### Bay Area
* Still expensive
* Get a SafeWay Card, it's free and literally saved me over $100
* Learn to love the Caltrain
* Caltrain isn't like the GO, they check your tickets all the time
* Go to Gilroy Premium Outlet Mall in Gilroy, it's amazing and has great deals
* Pizza Hut is not as fancy in the US. It will blow your coworkers' minds if you 
  tell them that Pizza Hut is a sit down restaurant with waiters
* Gilroy Premium Outlets is pretty awesome and worth a trip after your first 
  paycheque

#### Housing
* Foster City - [Sand Cove Apartments](http://www.woodmontrentals.com/sand-cove-apartments) 
  is a good apartment complex
  and they are very helpful with setting up housing for people out of the 
  country. They do flexible leasing and month to month rentals.
  In the past, QuinStreet co-ops have lived at the other properties owned by the 
  parent company (Woodmont, who seem to own a lot of land around here).

  * 2010W - Stephen - Liked it, very close to the old QuinStreet buildings.
    2 Bedroom 2 Bath $1909/mo.

* Mountain View - [Central Park at Whisman Station](http://www.centralpark-apts.com/)
  is a good apartment complex and they are very helpful with setting up housing 
  for people out of the country. 20 minute walk from Caltrain. Not that convent 
  for transit. Safeway is about 2 miles away.
  
  * 2012W - Stephen - We pay 2700/mo unfurnished plus utilities for 3 bedrooms.
    Clean and very nice. Less than 20 minute bike ride to Google.
    
<section id="Area-BayArea" />
### San Diego

#### Food
* Stephen waited in the rain for 2 hours to eat at [Phil's BBQ](http://www.philsbbq.net/).
  The ribs are amazing.


<section id="Area-NYC" />
### New York City
* Really expensive
* Paying first and last months rent plus one month of security is super common.
* Brokers fees are usually 1 month rent, often more than you'd like.
* Brokers fees are super negotiable
* More scammers here than any other place I encountered, see the place before 
  you pay
* Housing moves fast. We got an appointment to see a place, got on the subway 
  right away and once we got out the place was already taken
* Bring checks with you, that's how you secure a place
* Don't live above 100th Street unless you aren't afraid of anything
* Manhattan Costs Money
* Wall street area is surprisingly dead in the evening
* Brooklyn is much cheaper, consider it
* Middle of Brooklyn can be a little sketchier, but Bay Ridge is super beautiful
* Get a MetroCard pass on your first day, $104/mo for unlimited travel is a 
  great deal
* Trader Joe's is cheap
* Chase bank is everywhere (also in Duane Reade)
* Get a Duane Reade Card
* Watch your stuff on the subway, wallet in front and all that stuff
* Flying into LGA is cheaper, NJ transit is good, hard with two suitcases

#### Housing
* Brooklyn (Bay Ridge) - 328 91st Street, Brooklyn (close to the subway).
  The landlord is Annette Sobczynski (718-974-0368 annetteeve@hotmail.com).
  Multiple furnished apartments.

  * 2011S - Stephen - It was fully furnished for 1900/month, 2 bedrooms,
    large kitchen and a pullout bed in the living room. Stayed for 1 month while
    looking for apartments in Manhattan.
    
#### Food
* There are so many places to eat in NYC, try new stuff!
* Halcart at 53rd and 6th is to die for.
  Make sure you go to the [right one](http://www.yelp.com/biz/53rd-and-6th-halal-cart-new-york)
  Get the hot sauce. There will be a line, it is worth it.
* Pizza - In NY it's a different kind of food. It's also highly contentious 
  which place is best.

  * [Grimaldi's](http://www.grimaldis.com/) is usually number 1 or 2 on most 
    lists. It will be packed. Go on a weeknight. You will stand outside for 
    20-45 minutes or more. On Saturday expect over an hour. You can do take out 
    which will be a bit faster. Eat it under the Brooklyn bridge!
    
  * [Lombardi's](http://www.firstpizza.com/) is really good and in Manhattan.
    The wait is more reasonable.
    
* [Fat Cat](http://www.fatcatmusic.org/) is a nice bar and has lots of pool 
  tables, ping-pong tables and even scrabble. Prices are decent. Also allow 
  people under 21 in before a certain time.
* [Dallas BBQ](http://www.dallasbbq.com/) is really good and has awesome prices.
* [Carmines](http://carminesnyc.com/) is family style (gigantic plates) Italian 
  food and really tasty. Pretty busy.

#### Activities
* [Kayak on the river](http://www.downtownboathouse.org/) for free!
* The [American Museum of Natural History](http://www.amnh.org/) is large and 
  fun!
* Go to a comedy club.
